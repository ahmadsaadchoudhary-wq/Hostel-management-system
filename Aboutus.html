  <h1><b>Our Story</b> </h1> 
<p>Founded in 2005, Grand Hostel began as a small 12-bed accommodation with a simple mission: to create a welcoming space where travelers from around the world could connect, share stories, and feel at home. What started as a passion project between three travel enthusiasts has grown into one of the city's most beloved hostels, now hosting over 10,000 guests annually.
</p>
<h2><b>Our Mission & Values</b></h2>
At Grand Hostel, we believe that travel is about more than just seeing new placesâ€”it's about the people you meet along the way. We've designed our spaces to encourage interaction and community building, from our cozy common areas to our family-style dinners. Our team is committed to creating an environment where friendships are forged and memories are made.
<br>
